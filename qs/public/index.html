    <h3>Queer Definition</h3>

In history, The word "Queer" has been used to identofy something strange or odd. This is why there was a ongoing discussion about the word "queer". In the late 1980's, this word has been embraced by queer activists such as the Queer Nation. They have reclaimed the word and translated something into a progresive word. Nowadays, people in LGBTQ+ community has been using this word a lot. Currently, the word queer has been used to identify a broad spectrum of sexual and gender identities. </p>

        <br><br>That lifestyle is a sin.<br><br>

        Our mothers told us when we were little.<br><br>
        
        What caused your homosexuality?<br><br>
        
        We quietly cower: we feel brittle.<br><br><br>

        The church says Hell is for us.<br><br>
        
        We ask God: Am I forgiven?<br><br><br>
        
        
        
        They say we're mad at them,<br><br>
        
        With their compulsory heterosexuality.<br><br>
        
        Apparently lesbianism is a result of men.<br><br>
        
        We roll our eyes: they will know the actuality.<br><br><br></p>
